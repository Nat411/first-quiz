According to the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10, here are the areas I would scrutinize to enhance system security.
First, concerning "Injection," it's imperative to validate and sanitize inputs from the mobile application, web frontend, and Python backend to thwart Structured Query Language (SQL) injection and other code injection threats. Additionally, we should implement robust authentication mechanisms and access controls.
Furthermore, I will prioritize data security by encrypting sensitive information and fortifying the database to safeguard user data.
Lastly, I'll ensure that entities that receive input are configured to disallow the processing of external entities, addressing the risk of potential vulnerabilities.
It's equally vital to implement internal security measures by limiting access permissions, establishing strong identity and access management practices, and conducting regular security training for pur team. Continuous vigilance is key, and staying updated, conducting security audits, and collaborating with experts will ensure the resilience of our security infrastructure against evolving threats.
